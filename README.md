# exa-AMD
exa-AMD is a Python framework designed to accelerate the discovery and design of functional materials. The framework uses Parsl to build customizable and automated workflows that connect AI/ML tools, material databases, quantum mechanical calculations, and state-of-the-art computational methods for novel structure prediction. exa-AMD was designed to scale up on high-performance computing systems including supercomputers equipped with accelerators, such as the Nvidia and AMD GPUs.
To run the code, first change the settings in configs/std_config.json:
Change the directories to where the environment you are working on
Change the elements to the system you are working on,
and simply run python amd.py
